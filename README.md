# RecursiveFunctionPlotter
A function to give a better intuition of how recursive functions work.

I've always had trouble keeping track of variables in recursive functions, especially multiple recursive functions.

Run this line in MATLAB

y=recurplot(x,n)

Where 'x' is the size of your call stack
and 
'n' is the number of recursive calls within the function.
